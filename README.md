JRussell is a lightweight Java library for executing tasks in test environment.

It lets you wrap executable tasks and run them either sequentially or concurrently,
with built-in support for task configuration, decoration, and result inspection.

## Highlights

- Plain POJO library with no framework dependencies.
- Behaviorally opinionated, structurally flexible.
- Small, stable core with zero platform ambitions.
- No scheduling, no persistence, no nonsense.
